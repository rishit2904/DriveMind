# DriveMind: Intelligent Multimodal Route Optimization

## Project Overview 🚗

**DriveMind** is your smart companion for navigating the chaos of city traffic. By combining reinforcement learning (RL) with real-time data from traffic cameras, audio streams, and text reports, DriveMind helps you find the best routes—fast, safe, and eco-friendly.

---

## What Are We Building?

* **Real-time integration** of traffic, audio, and text data
* **RL-powered adaptive routing** (the system learns and improves!)
* **Personalized, up-to-the-minute navigation** for web or mobile

---

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Prerequisites & Setup

You’ll need:

* Python, JavaScript (React Native or Flutter)
* PyTorch/TensorFlow, HuggingFace, Stable-Baselines3/RLlib, YOLOv8/DETR, Whisper
* FastAPI or Flask, PostgreSQL, Redis
* Docker, Kubernetes, AWS or GCP
* CARLA or SUMO for simulation

### 2. Data Acquisition

* **Traffic APIs:** Mapbox, HERE, TomTom
* **Video/Image:** Public camera feeds, YouTube streams
* **Audio:** Public mics or user uploads, processed with Whisper

### 3. Data Preprocessing

* **Images:** Resize, normalize, detect objects (YOLOv8/DETR)
* **Audio:** Convert to spectrograms, classify with HuggingFace models
* **Text:** Summarize reports (T5/BART)
* **Tools:** OpenCV, librosa, HuggingFace datasets

### 4. RL Model Development

* Use Stable-Baselines3 or RLlib (PPO/DQN)
* Simulate with Gymnasium, CARLA, or SUMO
* **Reward:** Penalize delays/accidents, reward safety and speed

### 5. Backend API

* FastAPI for REST endpoints
* Real-time data and RL inference endpoints
* WebSockets for live updates
* PostgreSQL for users, trips, and logs

### 6. Frontend

* React Native or Flutter
* Real-time maps, alerts, and voice navigation
* Clean, distraction-free UI

### 7. Deployment

* Dockerize everything, orchestrate with Kubernetes
* Deploy to AWS or GCP, use S3 or Cloud Storage for data

### 8. Testing & Improvement

* Start with simulated data, then real-world
* Track: route accuracy, latency, user feedback

### 9. Monitoring

* Prometheus and Grafana for dashboards
* Watch for model drift, retrain as needed

## Developer Quickstart

### Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourrepo/drivemind
cd drivemind
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

### API Testing

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.drivemind.ai/v1/route" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "origin": { "lat": 19.0760, "lng": 72.8777 },
    "destination": { "lat": 18.9750, "lng": 72.8258 },
    "preferences": { "eco_mode": true, "avoid_tolls": false }
  }'
```

### Simulation Toolkit

```bash
python -m drivemind.simulator \
  --map ./assets/mumbai.net.xml \
  --demand ./data/trips.csv \
  --gui
```
